# Description

Deep Neural Network implementation using Tensorflow for recognizing image of digit between 0-9. It makes use of MNIST data set for training the DNN, this data set contains 28*28 pixel representaion of a image of digit. It is using 5 hidden layer with 100 neurons in each layer and got almost 100% accuracy on test set. This DNN is using Adam Optimizer instead of conventional Gradient Descent Optimizer that usually get stuck in local optima and fail to converge to global optima but Adam Optimizer uses different approach that usually leads to converging to global optima and faster than Gradient Descent.
